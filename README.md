# decNumber
This is Mike Cowlishaw's decNumber library that implements the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification in ANSI C. This specification defines a decimal arithmetic which meets the requirements of commercial, financial, and human-oriented applications. It also matches the decimal arithmetic in the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating Point Arithmetic.
